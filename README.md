### 1. Abstract and Introduction

**Motivation and Overview of the Research:** The Seamless family of models represents significant strides in speech translation by improving multilingual capabilities, expressivity, and real-time translation for a seamless, natural communication experience across languages. Speech translation has traditionally struggled to reach the sophistication of text-based translations due to challenges in maintaining voice style, prosody, and latency in translation. The paper addresses these gaps by building on the existing SeamlessM4T model to develop an enhanced SeamlessM4T v2 and introduces SeamlessExpressive and SeamlessStreaming, which further improve expressive and real-time translation capabilities.

**Challenges in Speech Translation:** A key motivation behind this work is the realization that traditional speech translation systems often lack the ability to capture the natural expressiveness of human speech. Most existing systems treat translation as a purely functional task, focusing on semantic content but ignoring elements like vocal tone, rhythm, pauses, and other prosodic features. However, in human communication, these elements are essential for conveying emotions, tone, and intent, making the conversation feel authentic. Additionally, maintaining low latency for real-time communication is vital but challenging, especially for streaming translation where we need to instantaneously translate without full sentence processing.

**Solution and Contributions:** To bridge these gaps, the meta has developed a unified system combining the advantages of expressive, low-latency, and multilingual support. Key contributions included are :

* **SeamlessM4T v2**: An advanced multilingual model trained on extensive data with improved semantic accuracy across languages and modalities.
* **SeamlessExpressive**: This one Focuses on translating vocal styles and prosody, making translated speech feel as natural and expressive as possible.
* **SeamlessStreaming**: It introduces low-latency, simultaneous translations that support many-to-many languages, leveraging Efficient Monotonic Multihead Attention (EMMA) for instant translations.

**Scope and Impact:** The resulting Seamless system, which integrates these three models, is the first of its kind to publicly provide expressive cross-lingual translation in real time, it is a major technical milestone in speech translation. By advancing toward a universal speech translator kind of sci fi, this work highlights both the technical and social potential for breaking down language barriers in real-time, making it an invaluable tool for users globally who depend on machine translation for daily communication, from social to professional contexts.

### 2. SeamlessM4T v2 Model: Improved Model for Low-Resource Language Translation

**Overview of SeamlessM4T v2:**
SeamlessM4T v2 builds upon the original SeamlessM4T to support more languages with higher semantic accuracy and efficiency in translation tasks. By expanding the language data set and enhancing the model architecture, this version can better address the need for reliable, nuanced translation, especially for low-resource languages where data scarcity has previously hindered performance.

**Training and Data Sources:**
The researchers focused on increasing the model’s language support by expanding the available training data. This included:

* **Multilingual Data**: SeamlessM4T v2 was trained with additional data aligned across 76 languages. This automatically aligned data included both high-resource and low-resource language pairs.
* **Pseudo-Labeled Data**: Pseudo-labeling techniques were used to leverage existing speech-to-text (S2TT) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) data, compensating for the lack of labeled data.
* **UnitY2 Framework**: This introduced a non-autoregressive (NAR) approach for predicting speech-to-unit translation, significantly improving the data efficiency and performance of speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) tasks. This framework allowed the model to handle diverse languages with different levels of resource availability more effectively.

**Technical Innovations in SeamlessM4T v2:**


1. **Enhanced Speech Encoder**: The model incorporates a new w2v-BERT 2.0 encoder, trained on 4.5 million hours of unlabeled audio data. This update increases the model’s ability to generalize across languages and handle low-resource cases more robustly.
2. **Hierarchical Upsampling in UnitY2**: UnitY2 leverages a hierarchical approach to predict subwords, characters, and discrete units, improving data efficiency and preventing output truncation or hallucination. This is essential for maintaining accurate translation flow, particularly for real-time applications.
3. **Multitasking Capabilities**: The model supports speech-to-text, text-to-text, and speech-to-speech translations, making it versatile for different use cases. It covers 100 languages as input and 96 languages as text output, with 36 languages available for direct speech translation.

**Model Impact and Language Coverage:** SeamlessM4T v2 can handle tasks like ASR, T2TT (text-to-text translation), S2TT, and S2ST across a broad range of languages. This expansive coverage increases accessibility for users from diverse linguistic backgrounds and represents a critical step in enabling real-time, natural translation for use in world.

### 3. SeamlessExpressive and SeamlessStreaming

**SeamlessExpressive: Enabling Expressive Translation**
SeamlessExpressive aims to capture the nuances of vocal expression, such as pitch, stress, rhythm, and pauses, to make translations sound natural and true to the speaker’s original voice and intent. This model supports the translation of five languages (French, German, Italian, Mandarin, Spanish) into English while preserving these expressive elements.


1. **Expressive Speech Preservation**:
   * By using specialized TTS (text-to-speech) techniques, the model can transfer vocal style from the source to the target language. This includes handling paralinguistic features that add emotion, tone, and personality to speech.
   * Techniques like voice style transfer allow SeamlessExpressive to mimic speech prosody accurately. This feature is critical for sensitive communications where tone and intent carry significant meaning, helping reduce misunderstandings due to mismatched expression in translation.
2. **Prosody and Vocal Style Modelling**:
   * Prosodic features like pauses and rhythm were preserved to align with the speaker’s intent. For example, a sarcastic remark in Mandarin should retain its intonation and pauses to convey the same sarcasm in English.
   * A reference-free cross-lingual evaluation method was also implemented to measure the prosodic consistency between source and translated speech.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   * To evaluate expressivity, the research introduced new metrics, such as AutoPCP (Automatic Prosodic Consistency Protocol), which checks for rhythm and prosody, and MOS (Mean Opinion Score) to measure human-perceived naturalness.

**SeamlessStreaming: Real-Time Translation with Low Latency**
SeamlessStreaming introduces a real-time, low-latency translation solution for simultaneous translation tasks. This model is powered by Efficient Monotonic Multihead Attention (EMMA), allowing it to generate translations without waiting for complete source utterances.


1. **Efficient Monotonic Multihead Attention (EMMA)**:
   * EMMA enables the model to produce partial translations as it receives continuous input, optimizing latency and accuracy in real-time. This process avoids the need to wait for a complete sentence or utterance, making it possible to translate simultaneously with speech input.
   * EMMA improves both processing efficiency and responsiveness, crucial for real-time applications where users cannot tolerate delays.
2. **Simultaneous Translation for Multilingual Conversations**:
   * The model supports simultaneous translation for multiple source and target languages, making it versatile for multilingual settings, like international meetings or conferences.
   * With support for 100 languages as input and 36 languages for direct speech translation output, SeamlessStreaming makes many-to-many, real-time translation feasible.
3. **Latency and Accuracy**:
   * Various latency metrics, such as Ending Offset (measuring the delay between source and translation completion), were used to evaluate SeamlessStreaming. Average Lagging was also calculated to quantify the synchronization between the speaker and listener in real-time settings.

### 4. Experiments and Evaluations

**Testing Methods and Performance Metrics**:
The Seamless models underwent extensive testing to assess their performance across different tasks, with a focus on quality, expressivity, latency, and robustness. Evaluations were performed using both automatic and human methods to ensure a holistic understanding of model performance.


1. **Automatic Metrics**:
   * BLEU and chrF were used for assessing translation accuracy, while Blaser 2.0 measured translation robustness.
   * Prosody was evaluated with newly developed metrics such as AutoPCP and rhythm evaluation tools, ensuring that expressivity in speech was preserved across translations.
   * For real-time translation, latency was assessed using metrics like Ending Offset and Average Lagging.
2. **Human Evaluations**:
   * Human evaluators rated the models for semantic preservation, naturalness, and expressivity. For instance, Cross-lingual Semantic Textual Similarity (XSTS) and MOS ratings were employed to measure the quality of translations and the naturalness of speech output.
   * For prosody, a modified version of the Prosodic Consistency Protocol (PCP) was applied to evaluate if the translated speech matched the source’s rhythm and tone.
3. **Responsible AI and Ethical Considerations**:
   * The models incorporated red-teaming exercises to detect and mitigate issues like added toxicity and gender bias.
   * A watermarking mechanism (SeamlessWM) was introduced to address the risk of deepfake misuse, adding inaudible signals to translations that enable authenticity verification without impacting user experience

.

* The research team documented a metric card summarizing evaluation methods, which provides transparency in AI performance and ethical responsibility.


4. **Robustness and Error Testing**:
   * The models were tested in noisy environments and with diverse vocal styles to ensure they perform reliably across different conditions. Seamless demonstrated resilience in maintaining accuracy and expressivity, even in challenging audio scenarios.

**Overall Results and Social Impact**:

* The Seamless models consistently outperformed previous speech translation systems in both expressivity and latency, achieving a new standard in natural, human-like multilingual translation.
* By making such technology publicly accessible, Seamless has significant implications for social inclusion, enabling non-native speakers and immigrants to communicate naturally in new linguistic environments, thus improving their confidence and social integration.
